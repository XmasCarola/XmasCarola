- 👋 Hi, I’m @XmasCarola
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, dancing and exploring.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, even if I would like to delve into other languages as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a great variety of projects, mainly on UX, UI and data tagging.
- 📫 How to reach out: function() { (spy on me) ? ("Do nothing") : ("Drop a message in my mailbox for a good chat >> carola.massardi@gmail.com") };
